# 🏋️ Gym Workout Optimization using Linear Programming

An intelligent workout planning system that uses **Linear Programming (PuLP)** to distribute exercise time efficiently based on user goals like **Fat Loss, Muscle Gain, Endurance, or Balanced fitness**.

Instead of guessing a routine, the optimizer mathematically finds the **best allocation of minutes** while respecting safety and duration constraints.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Select from **multiple exercises**
- User-defined **total workout time**
- Goal-based planning:
  - 🔥 Fat Loss  
  - 💪 Muscle Gain  
  - 🫀 Endurance  
  - ⚖️ Balanced
- Automatic constraint handling (min/max limits)
- Optimized calorie estimation
- Scalable model — new exercises can be added easily

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The system formulates workout planning as a **Linear Optimization problem**.

- **Decision Variables** → minutes per exercise  
- **Objective** → maximize goal-based fitness score  
- **Constraints** → total time, safety bounds, special rules  

The solver evaluates many combinations and returns the most efficient plan.
